Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and resources for my project on breast cancer detection using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a model that can accurately classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on histopathological data.

Features
Dataset: Utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

Algorithms: Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests to compare their performance.

Model Evaluation: Includes evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curves to assess the effectiveness of each model.

Cross-Validation: Utilized K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure the robustness of the models.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Performed hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search and Random Search to enhance model performance.

Results
The project demonstrated that [Insert Best Performing Model] achieved the highest accuracy of [Insert Accuracy Percentage], making it a reliable tool for breast cancer detection.

Future Work
Potential future improvements include:

Integrating deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based analysis.
Expanding the dataset to include more diverse samples.
Implementing a user-friendly interface for real-time prediction.
